    <p>Videos are becoming an increasingly popular way to consume entertainment. Whether it is on your TV, computer, or mobile phone, videos are a huge part of how we experience the world of entertainment.

Most of us have seen the great movies online and we've watched a few of them on Netflix or Amazon Prime. But when it comes to video compression, there are a few different techniques that are used.

1. What is compression?

Compression is a process of reducing the size of a file so that it takes up less disk space or bandwidth. This can be done in a variety of ways, with varying levels of quality.

A) Compression types

Some of the most common methods of compression are following:
• lossy 
 Lossy compression is the process of reducing       the size of a file, but at the expense of an information. However it makes the video look worse in order to reduce it's size.


• lossless. 
Lossless compression is the process of reducing the size of a file without losing any information. This is the most comman way used in movies.
